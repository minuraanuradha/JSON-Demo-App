# JSON Data Management App 📊

## Project Overview 📖
The **JSON Demo App** is a simple web application that allows users to manage and perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data stored in JSON format. It is designed for practicing working with JSON data and provides a lightweight solution for managing records. This app requires a local server (like XAMPP or WAMP) to run, as it uses PHP for server-side functionality.

## Features 🚀
- **Create Data**: Add new data entries to the JSON file.
- **Read Data**: View and retrieve data stored in the JSON file.
- **Update Data**: Modify existing data entries in the JSON file.
- **Delete Data**: Remove data entries from the JSON file.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **HTML**: For structuring the web interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the web interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling CRUD operations and managing JSON data.
- **JSON**: For storing and managing data in a lightweight format.
- **PHP**: For server-side processing, handling data manipulation, and interacting with the JSON file.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and modern styling of the web interface.
- **jQuery**: For simplifying DOM manipulation and handling events.

## Installation Instructions 🔧
To run this project, you will need a local server like **XAMPP** or **WAMP**:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/json-crud-app.git
    ```

2. Move the project to the `htdocs` directory of **XAMPP** or **www** directory of **WAMP**:
    ```bash
    C:\xampp\htdocs\json-crud-app
    ```

3. Start XAMPP or WAMP and ensure that the Apache and MySQL modules are running.

4. Open the `index.php` file in your browser:
    - Navigate to `http://localhost/json-crud-app/index.php` to run the app.

## Usage 🖱️
1. **Create Data**: Add new records by filling out the form and clicking the "Create" button.
2. **Read Data**: View existing data entries displayed in the list on the home page.
3. **Update Data**: Edit existing records by clicking the "Edit" button next to each record.
4. **Delete Data**: Remove unwanted records by clicking the "Delete" button next to each record.

## How It Works 🧠
The app works by loading and modifying data stored in a local JSON file. All data changes are directly reflected in this JSON file.

- When a new record is added, the app appends the record to the JSON data.
- When a record is updated, the app modifies the specific entry in the JSON file.
- When a record is deleted, it is removed from the JSON data.
